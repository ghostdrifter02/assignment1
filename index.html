<h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <div style="color:beige;">Hi everyone, my name is Hasham Baig, I live in the south-east of Melbourne in Hampton Park. I am 18 years old, and I graduated from Hampton Park Secondary College, now I am currently attending university at RMIT on the city campus undertaking my first year of Bachelor of Information Technology. My student number is s3901821 and my email address is s3901821@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia (Vic) and my parents are from India. I have one older sibling who also attends RMIT on another campus. The languages that I have some fluency in is Urdu and Hindi. My hobbies include playing games, watching tv shows, listening to music, hanging out with mates, and driving cars. I used to have two pet chickens who later went missing hours after buying them.</div>

<h2>Interests in IT</h2>
    <div style="color:beige;">My interests in IT are about the security of sensitive data and information that is blocked and stored safely away from trolls and hacker who have the same motive to corrupt data or leak information to the public. The idea of creating firewalls and installing biometrics to avoid data being leaked or corrupt fascinates me. The building of such advanced technology drives me into exploring and learning all the possible prevention methods and plans and procedures. Another interest in IT is self-driving cars and how the car industry is always trying to improve self-driving through AI. For me, the interest in IT started in high school.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <div style="color:beige;">The reason why I chose RMIT as my preferred university was through its reputation with IT and the level of involvement, they have with other IT companies and also, I’ve heard about all the great facilities that are provided to students and faculty. Moreover, to experience the city life of Melbourne as RMIT’s campus is the heart of Melbourne. Which provides a vast variety of flexible learning space. Overall RMIT is seen to be more unique to other universities which overall sums up why I chose to study at RMIT.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <div style="color:beige;">I’m expected to learn all of the course content and relevant information that is needed to achieve a satisfactory pass to move on to the course. Also, I’m expected to learn about IT in general and how the world heavily relies on IT as a means to move forward as a civilisation and how IT is improving day by day, thus requiring all the appropriate up to date skills and knowledge to solve any IT problem. </div>

<h3>Descripition</h3>
    <div style="color:beige;">I believe that a Cyber Security Analyst is hired by a company to assess and develop the best possible solution to protect sensitive information and data from unauthorised personnel and to avoid corruption of data and information. By building a stronger and secure system that is immune to hackers entering in, the company becomes resistant to any cyber-related attacks. The highlight of this position is to build and create a solution to prevent threats and attacks from occurring and also interacting with the company to create the best possible solution.</div>
<h3>Skills I have</h3>
    <div style="color:beige;">Currently, the skills that I have now are communication, working under pressure, working alongside a team, and determining all the solution requirements. I am familiar with Visual Studio and other software applications. I currently do not have any qualifications besides a VCE completion certificate. The experience with Visual studio was only around 7 months from learning the basics to building software for a client and learning the theatrical aspect of programming. </div>
<h3>Skills I need</h3>
    <div style="color:beige;">The skills that are needed for this role are mostly likely communication with the company as their comments and feedback is the foundation of your solution. Other skills include administration of information security systems, critical thinking, analysing company data and determining solution requirements. The qualifications that are required for this position is a degree in either information technology or computer science, other extra short courses of programming will further assist and overall help in general. The experience needed with high-level language will be around 5-10 years.</div>
<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
    <div style="color:beige;">My overall plan to obtain those skills is by familiarising myself with high-level programs and developing programming skills overtime. The qualifications will be obtained through the current course I am undertaking which is information technology and improving from there by completing some other related short courses. </div

          <h1>Project Idea</h1>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p style="color:beige;">My project idea will be a smart health consulting app that is made for patients who have previous health medical records that need constant attention or treatment and other individuals who need a general check-up. This app is made to help a patient book appointment with local general practitioners that are available and near the patient’s area. Also, the app has a local GPS tracker that identifies nearby services e.g., ambulance or local clinics that are available to arrive at your destination aid you. This app is user friendly and simple to use which enables all ages to interact with. Its main purpose is to help patients who need medical attention or other services, the app also consists of many other features that help an everyday patient. This is not specifically made for existing patients but other people too.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p style="color:beige;">This project idea will be useful to everyday people who do not have the time to go physically to the clinic and book an appointment as well as talking to the receptionist over the phone to book an appointment. However, booking an appointment through the health consultation app will become much more efficient and simpler than going to the local clinic as it takes away the hassle to wait in line. Another feature that would be useful is the real-time video consultation between the doctor and the patient through the application. According to OptiSol grandviewresearch “the global mHealth apps market size was valued at USD 12.4 billion in 2018 and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 44.7% over the forecast period”.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p style="color:beige;">The smart health consultation app has many features that are built into the app. One of the main important features is booking appointments with doctors who are available and near your area. An individual just simply needs to create an account, fill in their medical records and book an appointment with a doctor. Also, the patient has many options to choose from, whether it could be a specialist doctor or a general practitioner and also be able to choose a female or male doctor.</p>

          <p style="color:beige;">Another important feature is the app has a GPS tracker that notifies nearby ambulance or clinics for any case of emergency as it saves time to call triple zero and speak to an automated machine transferring you either to police or ambulance. The patients are also able to rate the severity of the situation to quickly notify the ambulance of the emergency. The app has a map of all the local clinics and nearby ambulance that show the opening hours and contact details.</p>

          <p style="color:beige;">An additional feature of the app is that it allows patients to store sensitive data like medical records and personal information into the app, no information is given to any other organisation or company without the consent of the patient. Not only are you able to store your medical data, but you can scan your heart rate or track your steps. Tracking your daily movements and intake of food can be tracked through the app. The doctor can only view your medical records with granted permission of the patient, the doctors can create meal prep ideas and suggestion on exercise that help improve your overall wellbeing by catering to your own needs and wants.</p>

          <p style="color:beige;">The app also has a feature to message or video chat the desired doctor to examine the patient’s health and communicate with them on the health issues with real-time consultation. This further helps the patient feel more comfortable to freely express their health concerns with the doctor.</p>

          <p style="color:beige;">The doctor can prescribe and send prescriptions to the patient online via the app. Which allows the patient to buy the prescription over the counter just by simply showing the prescription to the pharmacist</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p style="color:beige">The software that would be used to create this health consultation app is Bizness Apps as this software is the most appropriate for this project. The hardware that must be included for this app is a GPS receiver, touch ID, microphone, camera and accelerator. These are some of the appropriate hardware that is needed to create a health consultation app.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p style="color:beige">The skills required to create the health consultation app include knowledge of cross-platform development on other operating systems and mobile user interface design. Developing a high-quality user interface (UI) attracts a user to the app and learn its simple design without relearning it every time in use. Another important skill set is the knowledge and mastery of mobile application programming. However, building these types of skills do take time and effort and eventually, everything will fall in line.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p style="color:beige">The completion of successfully creating the project app will help individuals all around the world to find better care and also its right under their fingertips which makes it more accessible. By having a fully functional app, it solves the problem for patients to save time and interact with the doctors more comfortably without the pressure of going to the clinic and having an awkward conversation with them.</p>
